        <h2>What is Online learning?</h2>
<p>Online learning is a form of education that takes place over the Internet, using various technologies and platforms to deliver courses,
lectures, assignments, and assessments. O-Learning can be synchronous, meaning that learners and instructors interact
in real time. Or asynchronous, meaning that learners can access the materials at their own pace and convenience. 
O-Learning can also be blended, combining online and face-to-face components.

Online learning has many benefits, such as flexibility, accessibility, affordability, personalization, and diversity.
O-learning can also pose some challenges. Such as technical issues, isolation, motivation, and academic integrity. 
O-learning requires learners to be self-directed, disciplined, and responsible for their own learning outcomes.</p>
